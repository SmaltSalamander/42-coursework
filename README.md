# 42-coursework

Projects that I've been working on for the 42 cursus.

# Libft

Recoding of some of the C standard library functions as well as some other utility functions that will be used during the whole cursus.

# Getnextline

Introduction on reading content line by line. It is essential to be able to read from a file, stdin, or even a network connection.

# Printf

A recoding of the printf library, handling the cspdiuxX% conversions.

# Push_swap

This project involved sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, I had to choose among various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.
